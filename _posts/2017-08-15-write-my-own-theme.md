> I've tried many ways to build up my personal blog. I used to do it from scratch like writing HTML and CSS line by line. Or use other frameworks, such as WordPress, Drupal. But finally, I decide to use Jekyll to do it.


# Get start to use Jekyll
Jekyll is a static website framework, it is easy to build up a static website. And there are a lot of theme to use. The most important it super light, only several files to control the view which give the developer more freedom to customize their websites.
